# Supported resource types

<!-- Generated from internal/provider/aws. Regenerate with: go test ./internal/provider/aws -update -->

Supported means the type's placement, approved details and relationships are interpreted and tested against Terraform 1.16 and OpenTofu 1.13 fixtures with AWS provider 6.67. It does not mean every provider attribute is shown: tags, descriptions, policies, secret contents and similar free-form or sensitive values are withheld by design.

Any other type appears with limited detail and no placement, and `--strict` treats it as a failure.
