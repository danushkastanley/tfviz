# Test data

Everything here is synthetic. It uses the AWS documentation account `111122223333`, the TEST-NET ranges and `.invalid` DNS names. No real infrastructure or credentials appear anywhere.

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `stacks/aws-review/` | Terraform configuration for the review stack: VPC, subnets, routing, security groups, ALB, RDS, MSK, a Secrets Manager secret with an MSK SCRAM association, an SSM parameter and an EC2 instance. `var.phase` switches between the recorded (`prior`) and proposed (`proposed`) variants. |
| `producer/<tool>-<version>/plan.json` | Real `show -json` output for the proposed change |
| `producer/<tool>-<version>/state.json` | Real `show -json` output for the prior state |
| `producer/<tool>-<version>/prior.tfstate` | Synthetic raw version-4 state; the fixture for the raw-state reader |
| `producer/<tool>-<version>/VERSIONS` | Producer and AWS provider versions used |
| `canaries.txt` | Planted secret literals that must never reach a report |

## Coverage of the proposed plan

| Action | Example |
| --- | --- |
| create | New SCRAM secret, its version and the MSK association (inside `module.streaming`) |
| update | MSK broker type, RDS instance class and rotated password (sensitive value changed) |
| delete | Plaintext Kafka ingress rule (`count` index removed) |
| replace, delete first | NAT gateway moved to another subnet |
| replace, create first | Application security group renamed with `create_before_destroy` |
| read | Data source whose input is unknown until apply |
| no-op | 26 unchanged context resources |

Unknown values appear in replaced and created resources and in dependants such as the private route table.

## Regenerating

```bash
make fixtures
```

The `scripts/fixturegen` tool works as follows:

1. It plans the `prior` variant against an empty state.
2. It "applies" synthetically, filling each resource's own computed attributes with deterministic fake values. The producer itself propagates those values to dependants on the next plan.
3. When the synthetic state re-plans as all no-ops, it plans the `proposed` variant against that state.

Only `init` has network access, to download the pinned provider. Every other producer command runs with fake credentials and a dead HTTPS proxy, scoped to that child process. Any attempted AWS call therefore fails instead of leaving the machine. Ambient `AWS_*` variables are removed from the producer environment.

## Producer observations

These are findings from generating the fixtures; the readers must handle them.

- Both producers emit `format_version` `1.2` for plans and `1.0` for state.
- Terraform 1.16 emits `complete` and `applyable`; OpenTofu 1.13 omits both. Readers must treat completeness as "not reported" when it is absent, never as complete.
- `relevant_attributes` is emitted in non-deterministic order between runs, so treat it as an unordered set. Apart from that and `timestamp`, regeneration is deterministic.
- Plans contain sensitive values in plaintext: in `variables`, in `before`/`after`, and in `prior_state`. Exported JSON must therefore be treated as secret-bearing input.
- `provider_name` differs by producer: `registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/aws` or `registry.opentofu.org/hashicorp/aws`. Match providers on `namespace/type`, not on the registry host.
